    <h1>Artificial Intelligenc</h1>
    <p>AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to computer systems and machines designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding language. AI achieves this by processing large amounts of data, recognizing patterns, and adapting their behavior through algorithms that allow them to learn from experience. Examples of AI include recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and chatbots that can understand and respond to human language.</p>
